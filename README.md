# Angular2 D3.js integration

This is an example application demonstrating Angular2 D3.js v4 integration.

# Sources

* The D3.js code was adapted from [Chris Given's](https://bl.ocks.org/cmgiven) [Triangular Scatterplot](https://bl.ocks.org/cmgiven/a0f58034cea5331a814b30b74aacb8af) example.

* [tomwanzec's](https://github.com/tomwanzek) [d3-ng2-service](https://github.com/tomwanzek/d3-ng2-service) project was used for integration between Angular2 and D3.js v4's.

* Data came from [Insee](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/detail.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=ir-irsoceds2014). [Les decodeurs](http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2016/09/19/visualisez-vingt-cinq-ans-de-desindustrialisation-dans-les-departements-francais_5000083_4355770.html) have used that data to display a timeline map showing the importance of one sector through the years.

# Improvements

* As mentioned on Chris Given's page it would be nice to have the graph rotate smoothly around its center.
